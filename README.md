You will need to submit your code for each part in a Jupyter Notebook. Since each part builds on the previous one, you can submit the same notebook four times for grading. Please make sure that you:

use Markdown to clearly label your code for each part,

properly comment your code so that your peer who is grading your work is able to understand your code easily,

include your comments and discussion of the difference in the mean of the mean squared errors among the different parts.
